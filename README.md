# Udacity Feed Reader Project
--------------------
### How to run the app
To run the app just click on this [link](https://pasquale-guglielmi.github.io/udacity-feed-reader/) clone this repository and load the index.html file in your browser. At the bottom of the page you'll find all the tests that can be run by Jasmine ( a JavaScript testing framework). Tests are grouped into suites, each of which refers to a specific behavior that the app must satisfy.
To launch a specific test you can just click on it. There is also a link to run all tests together. If a test will fail then Jasmine will notify it to you.

### Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, already including [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even starting writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I'm left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where my job comes in.

### Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
